**Abstract:**

This article examined the relationships between time on the market (TOM), sale price, and list price of residential properties of Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in the mid-nineties to achieve market clearing mechanism. Multiple plots and two regression models were built to predict the time it takes for a property to sell in the market and sale price to list price ratio (SPTLP) with certain given characteristics of the property. This research considered 11 significant municipalities in GTA to see whether there would be an impact between urban and suburban municipalities. The results indicated that distance from downtown Toronto and whether the property had fireplaces were both significant important to TOM and SPTLP. Other important determinants for TOM were detached house structure type and SPTLP. Houses sold more than listed price had brick exterior and centralized air conditioning. In addition, overpriced houses had more days on the market, and as days on the market increased, the final sale price also dropped below list price. The finding of this study can be used to help home sellers to predict the time it will take for their listed properties to sell and the expected final sale price relative to the listed price.
